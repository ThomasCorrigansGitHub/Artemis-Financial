Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company trying to modernize their work by creating a web application but they wanted me to address security concerns with their software.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I was very good at adding the maven dependency check in the first project. It was very interesting to see so many vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the software.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
It was challenging to get all my work in on time because of my busy life so I hope I was able to bring my grade up by the end.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
To increase layers of security, I looked at what the issues they had were and recommended a solution such as a stronger cipher to protect against collisions.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the software application was functional and secure by refactoring the code and enabling HTTPS with a certificate to ensure that communications were not tampered with.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The dependency check for maven is one tool that I will continure to use in future assignments. I thought that was so helpful being able to scan for vulnerablities.000

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
The implementation of dependency check for maven is going to be helpful all throughout my career in cybersecurity.
